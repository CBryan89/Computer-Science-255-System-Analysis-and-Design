The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted to provide a system to help students prepare for their driving tests. The client needed a solution that allowed students to schedule driving lessons, access online learning materials, and track their progress. The system also had to support instructors, administrators, and secretaries with tools for scheduling, reporting, and managing accounts.

One thing I did particularly well was clearly identifying the different roles within the system and how each would interact with it. By capturing these details in both the business requirements and the system design documents, I ensured that the system supported not just students, but also the instructors and administrators who keep the program running smoothly.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the technical requirements section of the system design. I could add more specific details about the infrastructure, such as security requirements, data storage needs, and performance considerations. Adding these details would make the design more practical and ready for implementation.

To interpret the user’s needs, I closely reviewed the client interview transcript and extracted the key requirements. I then translated those needs into use cases, diagrams, and class structures that reflected how the users would actually interact with the system. Considering the user’s needs is critical because a system that doesn’t meet real-world requirements will fail to be adopted, regardless of how well it’s coded.

When approaching software design, I focus first on understanding the problem and then model the solution using diagrams and requirements documentation. I use techniques like UML diagrams to visualize workflows and object relationships, which makes it easier to validate designs with stakeholders. In the future, I plan to continue using an iterative approach—gathering requirements, modeling the system, and refining the design based on feedback—while also incorporating Agile practices to stay flexible and responsive to changing needs.
